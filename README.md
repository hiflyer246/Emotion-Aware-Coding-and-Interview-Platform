# 🎯 Emotion-Aware AI Mock Interview System for Skill Assessment

An AI-powered mock interview platform that combines **coding practice, emotion recognition, and progress tracking** to provide a personalized interview preparation experience.

The system analyzes a learner's emotional state during coding and interview sessions, helping identify patterns such as focus, confusion, frustration, and engagement. By integrating emotion awareness with technical skill assessment, the platform offers a more interactive and supportive learning environment.
